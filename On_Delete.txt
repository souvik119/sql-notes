- Example:

    CREATE TABLE branch (
        branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        branch_name VARCHAR(40),
        mgr_id INT,
        mgr_start_date DATE,
        FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
    );

    Imagine if in employee table one of the records is deleted, what will happen. 
    In this case it will set it NULL in branch table

    DELETE FROM employee
    WHERE emp_id = 102;

    In this case mgr_id wil be set to NULL where previously it was set to 102

- Options

    ON DELETE SET NULL
    ON DELETE CASCADE

    CREATE TABLE branch_supplier (
        branch_id INT,
        supplier_name VARCHAR(40),
        supply_type VARCHAR(40),
        PRIMARY KEY(branch_id, supplier name),
        FOREIGN KEY(branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    );

    If a particular branch id gets deleted in branch table the whole row will be deleted in branch_supplier table

    DELETE FROM branch
    WHERE branch_id = 2;

    If FOREIGN KEY part of PRIMARY KEY then cannot set it to NULL so ON DELETE CASCADE
    If FOREIGN KEY not part of PRIMARY KEY then can set it to NULL so ON DELETE SET NULL
