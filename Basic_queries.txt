    //select specific columns
    SELECT name FROM student;
    SELECT name, major FROM student;
    //could also specify column names like following
    SELECT student.name, student.major FROM student;
    //order the info
    SELECT student.name, student.major FROM student ORDER BY student.name; // in this case records displayed in alphabetical order of name
    SELECT student.name, student.major FROM student ORDER BY student.name DESC; //descending order by name
    //even order by attribute which is not displayed
    SELECT student.name, student.major FROM student ORDER BY student.student_id DESC;
    //order by multiple column names
    SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY major, student_id; // here first order by major and if anything has same major then order by student_id
    //LIMIT
    SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 2; //only return 2 rows


- WHERE clause:

    SELECT <rows> FROM <table name> WHERE <condition>;
    example:
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE major = 'Chemistry';
    SELECT name, major FROM student WHERE major = 'Chemistry' OR name = 'Kate';
    -- operators to be used with WHERE 
    -- <, >, <=, >=, =, <>, AND, OR
    SELECT name, major FROM student WHERE major <> 'Chemistry';
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE student_id <= 3 AND name <> 'Jack';
    //IN keyword
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE name IN ('Claire', 'Kate', 'Mike');
