- Definition

    Used to combine rows from 2 or more tables based on a related column between them
    4 basic types of joins:
    - INNER JOIN (NORMAL JOIN)
    - LEFT JOIN
    - RIGHT JOIN
    - FULL OUTER JOIN (COMBINATION OF BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT JOIN) this is not avaiable on mysql. In this case it will list all employees and branches

- Find all branches and the names of their managers

    SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
    FROM employee
    JOIN branch
    ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

- Find all branches and the names of their managers (left join this time)

    SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
    FROM employee
    LEFT JOIN branch
    ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

    All employees got listed not just the ones who were managers. Left join lists all rows from left table (FROM statement)

- Find all branches and the names of their managers (right join this time)

    SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
    FROM employee
    RIGHT JOIN branch
    ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

    All branches got listed. Right join lists all rows from right table (JOIN statement)
