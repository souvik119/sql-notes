    FROM employee
    WHERE employee.emp_id IN ();

    SELECT works_with.emp_id 
    FROM works_with

    SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name
    FROM employee
    WHERE employee.emp_id IN (
        SELECT works_with.emp_id

    FROM client
    WHERE client.branch_id = (
        SELECT branch.branch_id 
        FROM branch 
        WHERE branch.mgr_id = 102
        LIMIT 1
    );
    --since we are using = useful to have LIMIT set to 1
