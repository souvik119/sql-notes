- Intro to ER diagrams:

    ER - Entity relationship
    Entity - An object we want to model and store info about
    Schema - all the different tables and attributes (columns) associated with those tables
    ER diagrams are great way to convert business requirements to actual DB schema
    
    Entity - in rectangles
    Atrributes - in ovals
    Primary Key - in oval (underline)
    Composite Attribute - can be broken down into sub-attributes eg name -> first_name, last_name
    Multi-valued Attribute - can have multiple values (depicted with extra border in oval) eg clubs (could be more than 1 per student)
    Derived Attribute - can be derived from other attributes. depicted by oval with ---- border eg has_honors (derived from gpa)
    Multiple Entities - can define more than 1 entity in the diagram eg student, class
    Relationships - defines how 2 entities are related (diamond shape)
    Total Participation - All members must participate in the relationship eg all clases must be taken by students
    Partial Participation - not all memebers participate in the relationship eg not all students must take the class
    Relationship Attribute - eg student takes a class and gets a Grade so Grade is relationship attribute
    Relationship Cardinality - number of instances f an entity from a relation that can be associated with the relation
                                eg - student can take any number of classes, a class is taken by any number of students
                                1:1 - student can take 1 class and class be taken by 1 student
                                1:N - student can take 1 class and class be taken by many students
                                N:M - student can take any number of classes, a class is taken by any number of students

    Weak Entity - entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone eg exam cannot exist without class entity
    Identifying Relationships - A relationship that serves to uniquely identify weak entities eg exam relationship with class

- Example:

    We have to design a database solution for a school
