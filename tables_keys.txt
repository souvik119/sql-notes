- Table structure:

    All tables are made up of rows and columns
    1 column - single attribute
    1 row - an entry
    1 special coulmn - primary key that uniquely identifies each row in the table

    student id      name       major
       1            Kate       Sociology
       2            Jack       Biology
       3            Claire     English
       4            Jack       Biology
       5            Mike       Comp Sci

    If there is no primary key then no way to differentiate between the 2 Jacks with Biology major


- Surrogate key:

    if primary key is randomly generated and has no relationship to any real world data
    example - emp id of an employee table


- Natural key:

    if primary key value is any real world data itself example employee ssn in employee table


- Foriegn key:

    stores the primary key of a row in another database table
    example branch_id column in an employee table
    branch id is primary key in Branch table
    A way to define relationship between 2 tables
    A table can have multiple foreign keys
    Foreign key can refer to the same table also


- Composite key:

    Primary key is made up of 2 columns 
    Example - combination of branch_id + supplier_name in Branch supplier table
    Each of the 2 columns by thmeselves cannot uniquely id the rows
    Can be 2 foreign keys combining to make a primary key
