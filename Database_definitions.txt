- What is a Database:

    Any collection of related information
    Example:
    Phone book
    Shopping list
    Todo list
    Your 5 best friends
    Facebook's User Base

    Databases can be stored in different ways:
    * On paper
    * In your mind
    * On a computer
    * This text file
    * Comments section of a video

    Computers are great at keeping track of large amounts of information
    Computers + Databases = <3
    Case study - Amazon.com vs Shopping list scribbled on paper (or in the mind)

    Amazon.com:
    * Keeps track of prodcuts, Purchase orders, Credit cards, Users, Media...
    * Trillions of pieces of info needs to be stored and readily available
    * Info is extremely valuable
    * Security is essential as personal info isstored like credit card #, address..
    * Info is stored on Computer

    Shopping list:
    * Keeps track of products that need to be purchased
    * 10-20 pieces of info needed to be stored and readily available
    * Info is for convienece sake only and not necessary
    * Security is not important
    * Info is stored on piece of paper or in mind


- Database Management System (DBMS):

    A special software that helps users create and maintain a database. Features:
    - Makes it easy to manage large amounts of data
    - Handles Security
    - Backups
    - Importing/Exporting data
    - Concurrency : multiple operations at the same time
    - Interacts with software applications like programming languages : example amazon.com will interact with DBMS


- CRUD:

    Create Read Update Delete
    4 major operations on a database


- Types of Databases:

    * Relational Databases (SQL)
    - Organize data into one or more tables
    - Each table has columns and rows
    - Unique key identifies each row

    * Non Relational (noSQL/not just SQL)
    - Organize data in anything but a traditional table
    - Key - Value stores
    - Documents (JSON, XML..)
    - Graphs
    

- Relational Databases (SQL):

    - Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
        - Helps users create and maintain a relational database
            * mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB...
    
    - Structured Query Language (SQL)
        - Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
        - Used to perform CRUD operations and other admin tasks (user mgmt, security..)
        - Used to define tables and structures
        - SQL code used on one RDBMS not always portable to another without modification


- Database Queries:

    Requests made to database for specific info
    As the db structure becomes more complex it becomes more difficult to get specific info
    Example - google search is a query
